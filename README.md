# sagemaker-multi-models_endpoint
This is a sample code that shows how to scale training multiple models in the same custom container and deploy multiple models in the same endpoint.


In this example, I am creating a custom model using H2O Autoencoder estimator to predict anomaly scores. I am using a public dataset from Kaggle (Student Drop India 2016) available here: https://www.kaggle.com/imrandude/studentdropindia2016
